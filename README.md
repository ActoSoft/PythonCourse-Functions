# PythonCourse (Actosoft) - Functions
Exercises about functions to be resolved using Python. Python Online Course

## Before start coding
- Fork this repo into your Gihub profile.
- Clone the forked repo (repo on your profile, not in Actosoft profile).
- Start coding into the `/exercises` folder.

## While you're coding...
- Commit to your repo each time you finish an exercise.
- The commit message needs to be readable and understandeable. Messages like `done`, `finish` or `exercise one` are not specifics.
- Example of a good commit message:
```
Exercise #n is done. I solved this using a for to loop each element in the list and after that I calculate the average of something.
```

## After coding...
- Ensure all the exercises are solved and the solution works perfectly.
- Ensure all the exercises are on your repo, with the correct name and location.
- Create a Pull Request, from your branch master on your repo, to the master branch of the Actosoft repo (we saw how to do this on Wednesday 8 class 😉).
- Add your instructors as a reviewers into your Pull Request.
- Notify to your instructors and run for a beer.


# Exercises

## Factorial number

Write a function that receives as parameter one number (must be a integer) and return the factorial of that number.
Example:
```
input -> 5
output -> 120

```

`File name: factorial_number.py`

## Chicharronera

Using the chicharronera (fórmula general) find the values for x.
The user must enter the values for `a, b and c`
NOTE: As chicharronera only works with second grade ecuations. We must have two values for x.

## Areas Calculator

Write a program that start with a menu as follows. User can select the area it want to calculate. Write a funcion for each figure geometry to handle receive the values, calculate the area and print it.

```
CALCULADORA DE ÁREAS
==================================
1. Calcular área de un cuadrado
2. Calcular área de un rectángulo
3. Calcular área de un triángulo
4. Calcular área de un círculo
4. Calcular área de un polígono

¿Qué opción eliges?
```

`File name: areas_calculator.py`

## Areas Calculator (Pt. 2)

Following the above exercise, after the area value is printted, ask to the user if he want to calculate an area again. (`Hint: Use a cycle 😎`)
Also. If the user enter a incorrect option, print `Option is invalid`.

`File name: areas_calculator_2.py`

## IVA calculator

This calculator will receive payments for a person, and will calculate the IVA tax amount for each payment, and the sum of all the taxes. The program will have the following menu:

```
CALCULADORA DE IVA
==============================
1. Registrar nuevo pago
2. Ver lista de pagos registrados
3. Ver total de pago e impuestos
4. Salir
```

`Option 1`: Write a function to handle add a new payment. After the user enters the value, calculate the IVA of that value (16%). Save both values (you can use variables, lists, dict).

`Option 2`: Print all the payment registered and it's IVA tax. For example
```
    Pago #1 -> Monto: $3000.00 MXN -> IVA: $480.00 MXN
    Pago #2 -> Monto: $1000.00 MXN -> IVA: $160.00 MXN
```

`Option 3`: Print the sum of all the payment, as the sum of all the IVA taxes values

```
    TOTAL DE PAGOS: $4000.00 MXN
    TOTAL DE IVA: $640.00 MXN
```
The program must show until the user enter 4 to exit.


`File name: iva_calculator.py`

## Even or odd

1. Generate a list of number from 1 to 200 `[1,2,3...200]``
2. Write a function to know if a number is `even or odd`
3. Write function to save even numbers into a list
4. Write function to save odd numbers into a list
5. Write a function to iterate that list. For each number, check if the number if even or odd and save it in the correct list
6. Write a function to print a list (This function must be called two times. One for the even list numbers, and other for odd list numbers)

`File name: even_or_odd.py`


# Problems

Contact your instructors if you have any question or problem with this activity.
The communication with your instructors and other students it's only by Slack channel 😋.

# Happy Coding!
