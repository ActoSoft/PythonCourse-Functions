# PythonCourse (Actosoft) - Lists
Exercises about functions to be resolved using Python. Python Online Course

## Before start coding
- Fork this repo into your Gihub profile.
- Clone the forked repo (repo on your profile, not in Actosoft profile).
- Start coding into the `/exercises` folder.

## While you're coding...
- Commit to your repo each time you finish an exercise.
- The commit message needs to be readable and understandeable. Messages like `done`, `finish` or `exercise one` are not specifics.
- Example of a good commit message:
```
Exercise #n is done. I solved this using a for to loop each element in the list and after that I calculate the average of something.
```

## After coding...
- Ensure all the exercises are solved and the solution works perfectly.
- Ensure all the exercises are on your repo, with the correct name and location.
- Create a Pull Request, from your branch master on your repo, to the master branch of the Actosoft repo (we saw how to do this on Wednesday 8 class ðŸ˜‰).
- Add your instructors as a reviewers into your Pull Request.
- Notify to your instructors and run for a beer.
